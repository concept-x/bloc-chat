-a "stack trace" is all the calls that led to the error, line-by-line. It's 
 on the left-hand side, usually in red (when error), and looks like this:
  domElement.Node.call
  window.Calendar.getEventsByDate
  jQuery.event.dispatch

 Error lines are on the right-hand side and looks like this:
  filename.filetype.number
  Rooms.js.1
  index.html.35

******
Rooms.js

(function() {
    function Rooms($rootScope, Fixtures) {
         var Rooms = {}; //wtf goes here and inside?

         /*
         * @desc currentAlbum from Fixtures
         * @type {Object}???
         */
         var currentAlbum = Fixtures.getAlbum();
       }

       angular
           .module('blocChatEe')
           .factory('Rooms', ['$rootScope', 'Rooms', Rooms]);//'factory' is a recipe...???
       })();

{{Room.rooms}} ...??? Now, where did {{this notation}} go?
